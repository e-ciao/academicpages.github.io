Welcome to my website. This page is still under construction. More information will be added soon. Thank you for your visit.

I am currently a fourth-year doctoral student at the Department of Sociology in the University of Arizona. From the perspectives of organization theory and social networks, I study how community contexts influence organizational behaviors and outcomes and how organizations contribute to the innovative solutions for pressing social problems.

I earned MA in sociology from The University of Arizona in 2016. I also held a Master of Public Administration from Cornell University (Pi Alpha Alpha) since 2013. I call the University of International Business and Economics (Beijing) Alma Mater, where I earned BA in English during 2010. Prior to Tucson, I worked as a translator for the Delegation of European Union to China in Beijing and as a researcher at the Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.

I am blessed with the affectionate companionship of my beautiful wife and our lovely son. In my spare time, I like watching [*Huaju*](https://www.britannica.com/art/huaju), and sometimes acting myself given opportunities. In 2007, I acted the role of "Revolucionario" in the play [*Los Vendidos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Vendidos), and won the Best Supporting Actor in the 1st Beijing University-Wide Drama Competition. Something of which I would occasionally remind myself when I fail to reject the null hypothesis.
