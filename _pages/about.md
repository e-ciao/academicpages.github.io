Thank you for your visit! I am a fourth-year doctoral student at the Department of Sociology in the University of Arizona. 

Broadly, my research interests are about organizations and social networks. Specifically, I am interested in examining how social contexts of local communities influence organizational behaviors and outcomes. Substantively, I study corporate social actions, nonprofit organizations and social enterprises. Methodologically, I use a combination of regression, network analysis, and computational
methods to answer my research questions.

I earned MA in sociology from The University of Arizona in 2016. Prior to Tucson, I also received the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs Fellowship and earned my MPA from Cornell University as an inductee to Pi Alpha Alpha in 2013. I call the University of International Business and Economics (Beijing) Alma Mater, where I earned BA in English during 2010.

Priot to Arizona, I used to work as a translator for the Delegation of European Union to China in Beijing and as a researcher at the Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.

Iâ€™m blessed with the affectionate companionship of my beautiful wife and our lovely son. In my spare time, I like watching [*Huaju*](https://www.britannica.com/art/huaju), and sometimes acting myself given opportunities. As a sophomore in college, I acted the role of "Revolucionario" in the play [*Los Vendidos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Vendidos), and won the Best Supporting Actor in the 1st Beijing University-Wide Drama Competition of 2007. Something of which I would occasionally remind myself when I fail to reject the null hypothesis.
